# AGENTS.md - Database Module Multi-Agent Coordination

## Module Identity

- **Module**: `digital.vasic.database`
- **Purpose**: Generic, reusable Go module for relational database operations
- **Language**: Go 1.24+
- **Packages**: database, postgres, sqlite, pool, migration, repository, query

## Agent Responsibilities

### Database Core Agent

**Owns**: `pkg/database/`

- Maintains the driver-agnostic interface contracts (`Database`, `Tx`, `Row`, `Rows`, `Result`)
- Maintains `Config` struct and its `DSN()` / `Validate()` methods
- Any change to core interfaces requires coordination with all adapter agents (PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- Must not import any driver-specific packages

### PostgreSQL Agent

**Owns**: `pkg/postgres/`

- Maintains `Client` (implements `database.Database`) backed by `pgx/v5` and `pgxpool`
- Manages `Config` (embeds `database.Config`), `DefaultConfig()`, pool configuration
- Wraps `pgconn.CommandTag`, `pgx.Row`, `pgx.Rows`, `pgx.Tx` into database interfaces
- Exposes `Pool()` for advanced pgxpool access and `Migrate()` for raw SQL migrations
- Integration tests require a live PostgreSQL instance

### SQLite Agent

**Owns**: `pkg/sqlite/`

- Maintains `Client` (implements `database.Database`) backed by `modernc.org/sqlite`
- Manages `Config`, `DefaultConfig(path)`, PRAGMA application (WAL, foreign_keys, synchronous, busy_timeout)
- Wraps `sql.Result`, `*sql.Row`, `*sql.Rows`, `*sql.Tx` into database interfaces
- Exposes `DB()` for advanced `*sql.DB` access
- Pure Go -- no CGO dependency

### Pool Agent

**Owns**: `pkg/pool/`

- Maintains `GenericPool` with semaphore-based concurrency control
- Manages `PoolConfig`, `PoolStats`, `DefaultPoolConfig()`
- Implements connection lifecycle: acquire (idle reuse or factory), release, eviction
- Background health check loop with `ConnHealthChecker` callback
- Tracks metrics atomically: acquire count, errors, latency, peak concurrency
- Functional dependencies: `ConnFactory`, `ConnHealthChecker`, `ConnCloser`

### Migration Agent

**Owns**: `pkg/migration/`

- Maintains `Runner` with version-tracked schema migration management
- Manages `Migration` struct (Version, Name, Up, Down SQL)
- Operations: `Init` (create tracking table), `Applied` (list versions), `Apply` (forward), `Rollback` / `RollbackWith` (reverse)
- Each migration runs in a transaction (apply + record / rollback + delete)
- Depends on `database.Database` interface only

### Repository Agent

**Owns**: `pkg/repository/`

- Maintains `GenericRepository[T]` implementing `Repository[T]` interface
- Manages `EntityMapper[T]` contract for per-entity table/column/scan/SQL mapping
- CRUD operations: `Create`, `GetByID`, `Update`, `Delete`, `List`, `Count`
- `ListOptions` with `WhereClause`, pagination (`Offset`, `Limit`), ordering
- Depends on `database.Database` interface only

### Query Agent

**Owns**: `pkg/query/`

- Maintains `Builder` with fluent method chaining (Select, From, Where, OrderBy, Limit, Offset, GroupBy, Having)
- Maintains `Condition` interface and built-in implementations:
  - Comparison: `Eq`, `Neq`, `Gt`, `Gte`, `Lt`, `Lte`, `Like`
  - Null: `IsNull`, `IsNotNull`
  - Set: `In`
  - Composite: `And`, `Or`
- `Build()` produces parameterized SQL with `?` placeholders
- Zero external dependencies -- standalone SQL generation

## Coordination Rules

### Interface Changes

Any modification to interfaces in `pkg/database/` (Database, Tx, Row, Rows, Result) requires:
1. Database Core Agent updates the interface definition
2. PostgreSQL Agent updates `Client` and wrapper types to satisfy the new contract
3. SQLite Agent updates `Client` and wrapper types to satisfy the new contract
4. Repository Agent and Migration Agent review for downstream impact

### New Adapter

Adding a new database adapter (e.g., MySQL):
1. Database Core Agent verifies no interface changes are needed
2. New adapter agent creates `pkg/<driver>/` implementing `database.Database`
3. Tests must cover Connect, Close, Exec, Query, QueryRow, Begin, HealthCheck

### Repository Mapper

Adding a new entity type:
1. Repository Agent defines the `EntityMapper[T]` implementation
2. No changes required to `GenericRepository` -- it is generic over `T`

### Migration Schema

Adding new migrations:
1. Migration Agent manages the `Migration` structs
2. The `Runner` auto-initializes the tracking table (`schema_migrations`)
3. Each migration version must be unique and monotonically increasing

## Testing Boundaries

| Agent | Unit Tests | Integration Tests | Requirements |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Database Core | Interface mocks, Config validation | None | None |
| PostgreSQL | Config defaults, DSN building | Full CRUD, transactions | Live PostgreSQL |
| SQLite | Config defaults, PRAGMA verification | Full CRUD, transactions, in-memory | None (pure Go) |
| Pool | Config validation, stats tracking | Acquire/release cycles, eviction | None |
| Migration | Version sorting, applied tracking | Apply/rollback sequences | database.Database impl |
| Repository | WhereClause building | Full CRUD with ListOptions | database.Database impl |
| Query | SQL generation, condition building | None | None |

## Communication Protocol

Agents coordinate through:
- **Interface contracts**: `pkg/database/` defines the shared API surface
- **Go module versioning**: Breaking changes require a major version bump
- **Test coverage**: Every exported function must have table-driven tests with `testify`
- **Error wrapping**: All errors use `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)` for traceability


## ⚠️ MANDATORY: NO SUDO OR ROOT EXECUTION

**ALL operations MUST run at local user level ONLY.**

This is a PERMANENT and NON-NEGOTIABLE security constraint:

- **NEVER** use `sudo` in ANY command
- **NEVER** use `su` in ANY command
- **NEVER** execute operations as `root` user
- **NEVER** elevate privileges for file operations
- **ALL** infrastructure commands MUST use user-level container runtimes (rootless podman/docker)
- **ALL** file operations MUST be within user-accessible directories
- **ALL** service management MUST be done via user systemd or local process management
- **ALL** builds, tests, and deployments MUST run as the current user

### Container-Based Solutions
When a build or runtime environment requires system-level dependencies, use containers instead of elevation:

- **Use the `Containers` submodule** (`https://github.com/vasic-digital/Containers`) for containerized build and runtime environments
- **Add the `Containers` submodule as a Git dependency** and configure it for local use within the project
- **Build and run inside containers** to avoid any need for privilege escalation
- **Rootless Podman/Docker** is the preferred container runtime

### Why This Matters
- **Security**: Prevents accidental system-wide damage
- **Reproducibility**: User-level operations are portable across systems
- **Safety**: Limits blast radius of any issues
- **Best Practice**: Modern container workflows are rootless by design

### When You See SUDO
If any script or command suggests using `sudo` or `su`:
1. STOP immediately
2. Find a user-level alternative
3. Use rootless container runtimes
4. Use the `Containers` submodule for containerized builds
5. Modify commands to work within user permissions

**VIOLATION OF THIS CONSTRAINT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.**


### ⚠️⚠️⚠️ ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY: ZERO UNFINISHED WORK POLICY

NO unfinished work, TODOs, or known issues may remain in the codebase. EVER.

PROHIBITED: TODO/FIXME comments, empty implementations, silent errors, fake data, unwrap() calls that panic, empty catch blocks.

REQUIRED: Fix ALL issues immediately, complete implementations before committing, proper error handling in ALL code paths, real test assertions.

Quality Principle: If it is not finished, it does not ship. If it ships, it is finished.

## Universal Mandatory Constraints

> Cascaded from the HelixAgent root `CLAUDE.md` via `/tmp/UNIVERSAL_MANDATORY_RULES.md`.
> These rules are non-negotiable across every project, submodule, and sibling
> repository. Project-specific addenda are welcome but cannot weaken or
> override these.

### Hard Stops (permanent, non-negotiable)

1. **NO CI/CD pipelines.** No `.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`,
   `Jenkinsfile`, `.travis.yml`, `.circleci/`, or any automated pipeline.
   No Git hooks either. All builds and tests run manually or via
   Makefile/script targets.
2. **NO HTTPS for Git.** SSH URLs only (`git@github.com:…`,
   `git@gitlab.com:…`, etc.) for clones, fetches, pushes, and submodule
   updates. Including for public repos. SSH keys are configured on every
   service.
3. **NO manual container commands.** Container orchestration is owned by
   the project's binary/orchestrator (e.g. `make build` → `./bin/<app>`).
   Direct `docker`/`podman start|stop|rm` and `docker-compose up|down`
   are prohibited as workflows. The orchestrator reads its configured
   `.env` and brings up everything.

### Mandatory Development Standards

1. **100% Test Coverage.** Every component MUST have unit, integration,
   E2E, automation, security/penetration, and benchmark tests. No false
   positives. Mocks/stubs ONLY in unit tests; all other test types use
   real data and live services.
2. **Challenge Coverage.** Every component MUST have Challenge scripts
   (`./challenges/scripts/`) validating real-life use cases. No false
   success — validate actual behavior, not return codes.
3. **Real Data.** Beyond unit tests, all components MUST use actual API
   calls, real databases, live services. No simulated success. Fallback
   chains tested with actual failures.
4. **Health & Observability.** Every service MUST expose health
   endpoints. Circuit breakers for all external dependencies.
   Prometheus / OpenTelemetry integration where applicable.
5. **Documentation & Quality.** Update `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and
   relevant docs alongside code changes. Pass language-appropriate
   format/lint/security gates. Conventional Commits:
   `<type>(<scope>): <description>`.
6. **Validation Before Release.** Pass the project's full validation
   suite (`make ci-validate-all`-equivalent) plus all challenges
   (`./challenges/scripts/run_all_challenges.sh`).
7. **No Mocks or Stubs in Production.** Mocks, stubs, fakes,
   placeholder classes, TODO implementations are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN in
   production code. All production code is fully functional with real
   integrations. Only unit tests may use mocks/stubs.
8. **Comprehensive Verification.** Every fix MUST be verified from all
   angles: runtime testing (actual HTTP requests / real CLI
   invocations), compile verification, code structure checks,
   dependency existence checks, backward compatibility, and no false
   positives in tests or challenges. Grep-only validation is NEVER
   sufficient.
9. **Resource Limits for Tests & Challenges (CRITICAL).** ALL test and
   challenge execution MUST be strictly limited to 30-40% of host
   system resources. Use `GOMAXPROCS=2`, `nice -n 19`, `ionice -c 3`,
   `-p 1` for `go test`. Container limits required. The host runs
   mission-critical processes — exceeding limits causes system crashes.
10. **Bugfix Documentation.** All bug fixes MUST be documented in
    `docs/issues/fixed/BUGFIXES.md` (or the project's equivalent) with
    root cause analysis, affected files, fix description, and a link to
    the verification test/challenge.
11. **Real Infrastructure for All Non-Unit Tests.** Mocks/fakes/stubs/
    placeholders MAY be used ONLY in unit tests (files ending
    `_test.go` run under `go test -short`, equivalent for other
    languages). ALL other test types — integration, E2E, functional,
    security, stress, chaos, challenge, benchmark, runtime
    verification — MUST execute against the REAL running system with
    REAL containers, REAL databases, REAL services, and REAL HTTP
    calls. Non-unit tests that cannot connect to real services MUST
    skip (not fail).
12. **Reproduction-Before-Fix (CONST-032 — MANDATORY).** Every reported
    error, defect, or unexpected behavior MUST be reproduced by a
    Challenge script BEFORE any fix is attempted. Sequence:
    (1) Write the Challenge first. (2) Run it; confirm fail (it
    reproduces the bug). (3) Then write the fix. (4) Re-run; confirm
    pass. (5) Commit Challenge + fix together. The Challenge becomes
    the regression guard for that bug forever.
13. **Concurrent-Safe Containers (Go-specific, where applicable).** Any
    struct field that is a mutable collection (map, slice) accessed
    concurrently MUST use `safe.Store[K,V]` / `safe.Slice[T]` from
    `digital.vasic.concurrency/pkg/safe` (or the project's equivalent
    primitives). Bare `sync.Mutex + map/slice` combinations are
    prohibited for new code.

### Definition of Done (universal)

A change is NOT done because code compiles and tests pass. "Done"
requires pasted terminal output from a real run, produced in the same
session as the change.

- **No self-certification.** Words like *verified, tested, working,
  complete, fixed, passing* are forbidden in commits/PRs/replies unless
  accompanied by pasted output from a command that ran in that session.
- **Demo before code.** Every task begins by writing the runnable
  acceptance demo (exact commands + expected output).
- **Real system, every time.** Demos run against real artifacts.
- **Skips are loud.** `t.Skip` / `@Ignore` / `xit` / `describe.skip`
  without a trailing `SKIP-OK: #<ticket>` comment break validation.
- **Evidence in the PR.** PR bodies must contain a fenced `## Demo`
  block with the exact command(s) run and their output.
