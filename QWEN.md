# QWEN.md — Qwen Code context for this module

This file is read by Qwen Code as its module-context file. It is the Qwen Code
counterpart of CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md for this module, and it is a pointer:
there is one canonical agent-instruction file per scope.

## Read CLAUDE.md — it is mandatory

This module's canonical agent-instruction file is CLAUDE.md in this directory.
Before doing any work in this module, open and read CLAUDE.md and this module's
CONSTITUTION.md in full. Every rule there binds Qwen Code exactly as it binds
Claude Code.

This file is a plain-text pointer and deliberately uses no auto-import
directive. Qwen Code's memory-import processor resolves import-prefixed tokens
recursively, and the instruction files reference tokens that are not files. To
stay compatible with Qwen Code this file contains no such tokens — read
CLAUDE.md directly.

## INHERITED FROM constitution/CLAUDE.md

This module's CLAUDE.md inherits, unconditionally, every rule in
constitution/CLAUDE.md and the constitution/Constitution.md it references — the
HelixConstitution submodule mounted at the parent project's constitution/
directory (resolve the path with constitution/find_constitution.sh from the
parent project root). Qwen Code MUST NOT weaken any inherited rule.

## Anti-Bluff — read first

Tests and Challenges exist for exactly one purpose: to confirm a feature
genuinely works for a real end user, end-to-end. A test that passes while the
feature is broken is a bluff test and is forbidden. CI green is necessary,
never sufficient. See this module's CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and CONSTITUTION.md
for the full Sixth/Seventh Law and section 6.J / 6.L mandate.

## §11.4.78 — CodeGraph code-intelligence mandate

Inherited by §11.4.78 ID reference from `constitution/Constitution.md` §11.4.78 (this module's `CLAUDE.md` and `CONSTITUTION.md` carry the full anchor with the package name and install commands). In brief: every project worked on by AI coding agents MUST install, initialize, and use CodeGraph — a local semantic code-knowledge-graph exposed to agents over MCP — wired into every CLI agent the developers use, covered by an anti-bluff verification suite. See `CLAUDE.md` and `CONSTITUTION.md` in this module, and the constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.78, for the full mandate.

## §107 — Anti-Bluff Forensic Anchor (parity with CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md)

> **Verbatim operator mandate** (2026-04-29, reasserted multiple times across 2026-05; required to live in every submodule's Constitution.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, **and QWEN.md**):
>
> "We had been in position that all tests do execute with success and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the completion and full usability by end users of the product! This MUST BE part of Constitution of our project, its CLAUDE.MD and AGENTS.MD if it is not there already, and to be applied to all Submodules's Constitution, CLAUDE.MD and AGENTS.MD as well (if not there already)!"

**Operative rule applicable to Qwen Code sessions** working in this submodule:
the bar for shipping is not "tests pass" but **"users can actually use the feature."**
Every PASS in this codebase MUST carry positive runtime evidence captured during
execution. Metadata-only / configuration-only / absence-of-error / grep-based
PASS without runtime evidence are critical defects regardless of how green the
summary line looks. No false-success results are tolerable.

This anchor is the same text the existing CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md carry —
QWEN.md was added later in the propagation cycle and gains parity here.
For the full ruleset (Lava Sixth + Seventh Laws inheritance, the per-clause
enforcement detail) see this submodule's `CLAUDE.md` and the parent
`CONSTITUTION.md`.


## §11.4.83 — docs/qa/ end-user evidence mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.83)

> Verbatim operator mandate (2026-05-22):
>
> "every feature that ships MUST carry a recorded e2e communication transcript + any attached materials under `docs/qa/<run-id>/` (per-feature subdirectories). A feature with no QA transcript is itself a §107 PASS-bluff — it claims to work but has no auditable runtime evidence. Bot-driven automation MUST preserve full bidirectional communication threads as proof."

Every feature that ships from this submodule (or any consuming project) MUST carry a recorded end-to-end communication transcript plus any attached materials (screenshots, request/response payloads, audio, file uploads) committed under `docs/qa/<run-id>/` — one directory per feature run. A feature with no QA transcript is itself a §11.4 / §107 PASS-bluff: it claims to work but has no auditable runtime evidence that an end user actually exercised the feature through the same interface they will use in production.

Operative rule. (1) Maintain a `docs/qa/` tree (in the consuming project, or in this submodule when developed standalone). Each feature run lands under `docs/qa/<run-id>/` where `<run-id>` is monotonic + greppable. (2) Transcripts MUST be full bidirectional — every prompt/command sent + every response received. One-sided is not a transcript. (3) Attached materials MUST live in-repo (no external-only links — that is §11.4.13 sink-side violation). (4) Bot-driven / agent-driven QA automation MUST preserve the full conversation thread as the proof artefact. (5) CI release gates MUST refuse to tag a version that has any feature-shipping commit without its matching `docs/qa/<run-id>/`.

Composes with §11.4.2, §11.4.5, §11.4.13, §11.4.65, §11.4.69, §107, §1.1.

**Cascade requirement:** this anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.83` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `QWEN.md`.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.83 for the full mandate.

Non-compliance is a release blocker. No `--qa-evidence-optional`, `--qa-transcript-later`, `--qa-bot-summary-suffices` flag exists.

## §11.4.84 — Working-tree quiescence rule for subagent commits (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.84)

**Short tag:** `working-tree quiescence`.

> Verbatim operator mandate (2026-05-22):
>
> "no subagent commit may proceed while any concurrent mutation gate is in flight in the same checkout. Before `git add`, the committing agent MUST `grep` its own working tree for mutation markers (`MUTATED for paired`, `// always pass`, `return json.Marshal` shortcut paths, etc.). Any unexplained file in the staging area triggers ABORT."

No subagent (or main-thread) commit may proceed while any concurrent mutation gate, paired-mutation experiment, or other in-flight mutation is live in the same checkout. Before `git add`, the committing agent MUST grep its own working tree for mutation markers (`MUTATED for paired`, `// always pass`, `return json.Marshal` shortcut paths, `// MUTATION` / `# MUTATION` annotations, `_mutated_*` filename suffixes, etc.) and explicitly account for every modified file in the staging area. Any unexplained file → ABORT.

**Lesson (forensic case study).** A consuming project's logo-fix subagent (Herald commit `72e81ab`, 2026-05-21) ran in a checkout where a paired §1.1 mutation gate had temporarily introduced an `// always pass` shortcut into a JWT verify path. The subagent's `git add` swept the mutation residue into the same commit as the unrelated logo fix, and the resulting commit was pushed to all four mirrors before any other agent caught it. The fix (Herald `d5bd360`, "SECURITY FIX: restore commons_auth/middleware.go JWT verify") landed within the hour, but the window during which production-equivalent binaries shipped with a bypassed JWT verify is a real security-defect window. The lesson is now constitutional.

Operative rule. (1) Pre-`git add` MUST grep for mutation markers + cross-check `git status --porcelain` against the subagent's declared scope; unaccounted entries → ABORT. (2) Any active mutation gate MUST be serialised — mutate → assert FAIL → restore → assert PASS — and the working tree MUST be verifiably clean BEFORE any unrelated commit. (3) Concurrent subagents in the SAME checkout MUST coordinate through a lockfile (`.git/MUTATION_IN_PROGRESS`); the cleaner solution is `git worktree add` per subagent (composes with §11.4.20/§11.4.70). (4) Post-commit `mutation-residue-scanner` MUST run before push; any commit containing a mutation marker → push BLOCKED.

Composes with §1.1, §11.4.20, §11.4.70, §11.4.27, §11.4.10, §11.4.71, §107.

**Cascade requirement:** this anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.84` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `QWEN.md`.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.84 for the full mandate.

Non-compliance is a release blocker. A mutation marker that lands in a tagged commit is a critical defect regardless of how briefly it persisted.

## §107 — End-user-usability covenant (verbatim operator mandate, 2026-05-22)

> **Verbatim operator mandate** (2026-05-22, restated for QWEN.md parity per the §11.4.83 cascade requirement):
>
> "all existing tests and Challenges do work in anti-bluff manner - they MUST confirm that all tested codebase really works as expected! We had been in position that all tests do execute with success and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the completition and full usability by end users of the product! This MUST BE part of Constitution of our project, its CLAUDE.MD and AGENTS.MD if it is not there already, and to be applied to all Submodules's Constitution, CLAUDE.MD and AGENTS.MD as well (if not there already)!"

**Inheritance.** This submodule's consumers (Herald and any other downstream project) inherit the §107 covenant unchanged. The bar for shipping any consumer-visible feature is NOT "tests pass" — it is **"the end user of the binary or library that consumes this submodule can actually use the feature."** Every PASS (unit, integration, gate, Challenge, smoke, e2e) MUST carry positive runtime evidence that the user-visible behaviour works. Metadata-only / configuration-only / "absence-of-error" / grep-only PASS are §11.4 PASS-bluffs and constitute critical defects regardless of how green the summary line looks.

**Evidence responsibility.** §107 evidence inside this submodule is the responsibility of the submodule's own unit + integration tests + Challenges. §107 evidence for a consumer-visible feature that traverses this submodule is the responsibility of the consumer's end-to-end proofs (Herald's `scripts/e2e_bluff_hunt.sh` + the per-feature `docs/qa/<run-id>/` artefact mandated by §11.4.83).

**Canonical authority.** Helix Universal Constitution §11.4 + §11.4.1..§11.4.16 (anti-bluff substrate) and the existing §107 anchor already carried by this submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. This QWEN.md section restates the anchor for Qwen Code session parity per the operator's 2026-05-22 mandate that the §107 covenant MUST appear in every QWEN.md across the Helix-stack inheritance chain.

**Non-compliance is a release blocker.** No `--metadata-only-suffices`, `--green-summary-suffices`, `--coverage-suffices` flag exists.

## §11.4.69 — Universal Sink-Side Positive-Evidence Taxonomy + Mechanical Enforcement (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.69)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"THIS MUST HAPPEN NEVER AGAIN!!! We MUST HAVE this all working! Not just for audio but for every single piece of the System!!! Proper full automation when executed with success MUST MEAN that manual testing will be as much positive at least regarding the success results! ... Solution MUST BE universal, generic that solves working flows for all System components and for all future and all existing projects! ... Everything we do MUST BE validated and verified with rock-solid proofs and anti-bluff policy enforcement and fulfillment!"*

Universal generalisation of §11.4.68 (audio-specific) across every user-visible feature class. Every user-visible feature MUST map to one entry in the closed-set §11.4.69 sink-side evidence taxonomy (`audio_output`, `audio_input`, `video_display`, `network_throughput`, `network_connectivity`, `bluetooth_a2dp`, `bluetooth_pair`, `touch_input`, `sensor`, `gpu_render`, `storage_read`, `storage_write`, `mediacodec_decode`, `mediacodec_encode`, `miracast`, `cast`, `boot_service`, `package_install`, `permission_grant`, `wifi_link`, `wifi_throughput`, `ethernet_link`, `display_topology`, `drm_playback`, `subtitle_render` — open to additions, never contraction). Every PASS for a feature in the taxonomy MUST cite a captured-evidence artefact path matching the required evidence shape. New helper contracts (additive during grace, mandatory after 2026-06-19): `ab_pass_with_evidence <description> <evidence_path>` (verifies path exists + non-empty), `ab_skip_with_reason <description> <closed-set-reason>` (reasons: `geo_restricted`, `operator_attended`, `hardware_not_present`, `topology_unsupported`, `network_unreachable_external`, `feature_disabled_by_config`; forbids `network_unreachable_external` for any taxonomy feature with a sink-side probe); bare `ab_pass` deprecated (WARN pre-grace, FAIL post-grace). Three pre-build gates + paired §1.1 mutations: `CM-SINK-EVIDENCE-PER-FEATURE`, `CM-NO-FAIL-OPEN-SKIP`, `CM-AB-PASS-WITH-EVIDENCE-EVERYWHERE`. No escape hatch — no `--skip-evidence`, `--config-only-pass`, `--allow-fail-open-skip`, `--legacy-ab-pass-permitted` flag.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.69` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-69-PROPAGATION` enforces the anchor literal across the consumer fleet; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the sink-side-evidence layer.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.69 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.75 — Mechanical Enforcement Without Exception (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.75)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"Why do these violations still happen!? This is a serious problem! We cannot rely on stability nor consistency if we cannot respect our Constitution, mandatory rules and constraints! Is there a way to make this always respected, followed and applied without exception fully and unconditionally!? WE MUST HAVE THIS WORKING FLAWLESSLY!!! Do investigate the root causes of such problems! Once all problems are identified WE MUST apply proper mechanisms for this not to happen NEVER EVER AGAIN!"*

The §11.4 covenant historically relied on agent + operator vigilance; three 2026-05-19→20 forensic incidents proved that late-binding enforcement fires hours-to-days after the violator commit reaches every remote. §11.4.75 closes the gap with FIVE independent mechanical enforcement layers — bypassing any single layer does not bypass the discipline: (1) local `pre-commit` git hook (refuses staged `.md` lacking sibling `.html`+`.pdf`); (2) `commit_all.sh` integration (`_constitution_sibling_check` + auto-`sync_all_markdown_exports.sh` self-repair); (3) local `pre-push` git hook (re-runs siblings + propagation-gate subset); (4) `post-commit` auto-repair hook (auto-generates orphan-`.md` siblings, idempotent + recursion-guarded); (5) local-only final-gate ritual (remote CI DISABLED per User mandate — operator runs `pre_build_verification.sh` + meta-test before every tag per §11.4.40). Helper contracts: `scripts/install_git_hooks.sh`, `scripts/git_hooks/{pre-commit,pre-push,post-commit,commit-msg}`, `_constitution_sibling_check`. The `commit-msg` hook enforces a `Bypass-rationale: <reason>` footer when `--no-verify` is detected; `docs/audit/bypass_events.md` accumulates the audit trail. Five gates with paired §1.1 mutations: `CM-COVENANT-114-75-PROPAGATION`, `CM-GIT-HOOKS-INSTALL-SCRIPT`, `CM-GIT-HOOKS-SOURCE-DIR`, `CM-COMMIT-ALL-SIBLING-CHECK`, `CM-CI-WORKFLOW-PRESENT`. No escape hatch — no `--skip-hooks`, `--bypass-enforcement`, `--allow-orphan-md`, `--ci-not-applicable`, `--mechanical-enforcement-not-needed` flag.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.75` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-75-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the enforcement layer.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.75 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.76 — Containers-Submodule Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.76)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"For any work or requirements of running services or codebase inside the Containers (Docker / Podman / Qemy / Emulators, and so on) we MUST USE / INCORPORATE the Containers Submodule properly: https://github.com/vasic-digital/containers (git@github.com:vasic-digital/containers.git). Containers Submodule contains all means for us to Containerize our code and services! If any feature or Containing System is missing or not supported we MUST EXTEND IT properly like we do all of our projects! No bluff work is allowed of any kind!"*

For ANY containerized workload (Docker / Podman / Qemu / Kubernetes / container-backed emulators), every consuming project MUST: (1) install `vasic-digital/containers` (`digital.vasic.containers`) as a Git submodule; (2) consume via `replace` directive during development + pinned commit SHAs in production; (3) boot infra on-demand via `pkg/boot` + `pkg/compose` + `pkg/health` so operators are never required to start `podman machine` / `docker compose up` manually — the boot is part of the test entry point (the on-demand-infra invariant); (4) extend the Submodule (PR upstream) for missing runtimes / lifecycle primitives — never reimplement in-project (per §11.4.74); (5) anti-bluff: integration tests claiming to exercise containerized components MUST actually boot them via the Submodule — short-circuit fakes that bypass boot are a §11.4 violation. Tracker rows touching containerization MUST record `Catalogue-Check: extend vasic-digital/containers@<sha>` (or `reuse`). Planned gate `CM-CONTAINERS-USED` scans container-touching PRs for `digital.vasic.containers/...` imports; paired mutation strips the import + asserts FAIL.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.76` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-76-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.76 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.77 — Regeneration-Mechanism-Required Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.77)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-20): *"We must be sure that after excluding anything from Git versioning we still have the mechanism which will out of the box obtain or re-generate missing content!"*

Every `.gitignore` entry excluding (a) >~100 MiB OR (b) any artefact essential to building / running / testing the project MUST carry a documented + automated mechanism to either re-obtain (download from authoritative source: vendor tarball, SDK installer, npm/pip/cargo/go-mod/container registry, dedicated git submodule, S3/GCS) OR re-generate (run from tracked source via build pipeline, code-gen, asset render, captured-evidence replay, container build). Required artefacts per qualifying entry: (1) `.gitignore-meta/<entry-slug>.yaml` declaring pattern + mechanism-type + script-path + expected-disk-usage + vendor-url-or-source + integrity hash + requires-network + requires-credentials; (2) a non-interactive entry in `scripts/setup.sh` post-clone bootstrap; (3) a pre-build gate verifying regenerated content present OR a recent `.gitignore-meta/.regenerated/<slug>.ok` stamp; (4) README + `docs/guides/*.md` describing the mechanism + manual fallback + time/disk budget + §11.4.10 credentials. Bare `.gitignore` additions without the mechanism are a §11.4 PASS-bluff variant — codebase appears complete but a fresh clone cannot build/run. No escape hatch — no `--skip-regen-mechanism`, `--gitignore-is-enough`, `--operator-already-has-content` flag. Planned gate `CM-GITIGNORE-REGEN-MECHANISM` + paired §1.1 mutation (strip a required YAML key → gate FAILs).

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.77` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-77-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Severity-equivalent to a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the repository-hygiene layer.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.77 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.79 — Own-Org Submodules MUST Be Included in the CodeGraph Index (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.79)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-21): *"All Submodules we use in the project and that are part of organizations to which we have the full access via GitHub, GitLab and other CLIs MUST BE included into the codegraph database and initialized / scanned / synced!"*

Refines §11.4.78's exclude-list with a per-submodule-ownership split: (a) own-org submodules (full write access via the project's CLIs — canonical orgs `vasic-digital` + `HelixDevelopment`) MUST be INCLUDED in the index; (b) third-party submodules (the §11.4.74 `no-match → vendor` path) MUST be EXCLUDED. Operational steps: (1) `git submodule update --remote --merge` to pull latest before re-indexing, respecting load-bearing pins on third-party submodules; (2) adjust `.codegraph/config.json` exclude list to keep own-org paths in scope; (3) re-index via `scripts/codegraph_setup.sh`; (4) verify via `scripts/codegraph_validate.sh` with ≥1 probe resolving a symbol living ONLY inside an own-org submodule; (5) paired §1.1 mutation — temporarily add the own-org submodule to exclude → validate MUST FAIL on the cross-submodule probe → restore. An index that lies about reachable symbols is a PASS-bluff against AI agents. Own-org submodules silently excluded without an audit trail in `.codegraph/config.json` comments is a release blocker.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.79` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-79-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.79 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.80 — CodeGraph Regular-Update + Sync Automation Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.80)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-21): *"We MUST regularly check for the updates and execute codegraph npm updates so the latest version of it is always installed on the host machine! ... Make sure we have proper full automation bash scripts which will run regularly and that these are part of the constitution Submodule ... Make sure all updates, sync processes we do and important codegraph related events are all documented under docs/codegraph in Status and Status_Summary documents ... and regularly export them like all other Status docs into the PDF and HTML!"*

Three deliverables (all living in the constitution submodule, inherited by reference per §3 — consuming projects invoke at `${CONST_DIR}/scripts/codegraph_*.sh`, never copy): (1) `scripts/codegraph_update.sh` — npm-installs latest `@colbymchenry/codegraph` after a registry version check; appends old/new version to `docs/codegraph/Status.md`; anti-bluff verifies `codegraph --version` reflects the new version after install (npm exit 0 ≠ working binary). (2) `scripts/codegraph_sync.sh` — after a successful update runs `codegraph status` → `codegraph sync .` → `codegraph status` → the project's `scripts/codegraph_validate.sh`; appends every step's output to BOTH the project's and the constitution's `docs/codegraph/Status.md`. (3) `docs/codegraph/Status.md` + `Status_Summary.md` append-only ledgers, exported to `.html` + `.pdf` per §11.4.65. Cadence: weekly floor (per §11.4.45). A consuming project that has not run `codegraph_update.sh` in >2 weeks AND has open AI-agent work is a release blocker. Paired §1.1 mutation: downgrade installed version → script detects drift → restore.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.80` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-80-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.80 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.81 — Cross-Platform-Parity Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.81)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-21): *"Any Linux-only blocker / issue we have MUST BE created macOS and other supported platforms equivalent! So, depending on platform proper implementation will be used for particular OS! EVERYTHING MUST BE PROPERLY EXTENDED AND UPDATED!"*

Every consuming project whose supported-platforms manifest lists more than one OS MUST, for every feature/test/gate/challenge/mutation depending on platform-specific primitives, ship a per-OS-equivalent implementation chosen at runtime via `uname -s` (or equivalent detection). Three sub-mandates: **(A) Per-OS implementation REQUIRED** — Linux cgroup/systemd/`/proc` primitives MUST have documented per-OS equivalents (POSIX `setrlimit`/`ulimit`, macOS `launchd`, BSD `rctl`, Windows Job Object) chosen via runtime dispatch. **(B) Per-OS tests REQUIRED** — every platform-dependent gate test MUST have `case "$(uname -s)" in` branches with positive captured evidence per §11.4.2 + §11.4.5 in each branch; SKIP-with-reason acceptable ONLY when the platform genuinely cannot enforce the invariant. **(C) Honest kernel-gap citation + adjacent equivalent test REQUIRED** — where a Linux primitive has NO equivalent due to a documented kernel limitation (canonical: XNU does not enforce `RLIMIT_AS` for unprivileged processes), the test MUST detect the gap at runtime, SKIP with exact kernel reason + reproducer + honest-gap-doc link, AND provide an ADJACENT test exercising the closest invariant the platform CAN enforce (e.g. `RLIMIT_CPU`+`SIGXCPU` as the macOS proxy), itself anti-bluff with a paired §1.1 mutation. Gate `CM-CROSS-PLATFORM-PARITY` scans for `case "$(uname -s)"` blocks asserting a non-SKIP branch (or honest-gap citation) per platform in the manifest; paired mutation strips a Darwin branch → gate FAILs. No escape hatch.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.81` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-81-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker on multi-platform projects.
**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule `Constitution.md` §11.4.81 for the full mandate.

## §11.4.82 — Iteration-Speedup Discipline Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.82)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-22): *"How can we speed-up this whole development and fixing process? ... Do not forget to all speed optimizations critical rules and mandatory constraints MUST BE all added into our root (constitution Submodule) Constitution.md, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md and QWEN.md and all other relevant constitution Submodules files!"*

Iteration cycle time is a first-order quality enabler. Every consuming project's build / test / commit / debug pipeline MUST adopt these speedup disciplines AS MANDATORY (each independently enforceable): (A) Phase-1 forensic (`superpowers:systematic-debugging`) before any speculative source patch — speculative patches without FACT-grade root cause are §11.4.6 + §11.4.82 violations; (B) Live-ADB-First (or live-equivalent) before any rebuild — strengthens §11.4.51 to a release-blocker mandate; (C) 30-second pre-flight before launching rebuild orchestrators (device/sink reachability, host memory/disk, no stale locks, no orphan processes); (D) persistent build caches outside containers (`ccache`/`sccache`/Gradle daemon bind-mounted to host); (E) module-only rebuild for loadable-module-only changes; (F) parallel multi-device testing with separate `qa-results/<TS>/<device-tag>/` outputs; (G) subagent scope discipline + worktree isolation (≤30 min budget, single-responsibility, `isolation: "worktree"` default); (H) lock-file + stale-process hygiene (clean `.git/index.lock`, disable auto git-gc in concurrent repos); (I) cycle telemetry per §11.4.24 (commit hash, per-phase wall-clock, speedup-flag set, outcome — aggregated weekly). Gate `CM-ITERATION-SPEEDUP-DISCIPLINE` audits recent cycles for telemetry citing which of (A)-(I) applied; paired §1.1 mutation strips the speedup-flag column → gate FAILs. No escape hatch — no `--skip-phase1-forensic`, `--no-pre-flight`, `--rebuild-everything-always`, `--unlimited-subagent-scope`, `--ignore-locks`, `--no-telemetry` flag.

## §11.4.85 — Stress + Chaos Test Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.85)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-24): *"Every fix or improvement you do MUST BE covered with full automation stress and chaos tests so we are sure nothing can break the functionality and all edge cases are monitored and polished and additionally fixed if that is needed! Everything must produce rock solid proofs and follow fully no-bluff policy!"*

Every fix or improvement landed MUST ship with full-automation **stress** AND **chaos** test suites exercising edge cases, sustained load, concurrent contention, and failure-injection. Happy-path coverage alone is a §11.4 / §107 PASS-bluff at the resilience layer. **Stress** (closed-set): sustained load (N ≥ 100 iterations OR ≥ 30 s wall-clock, p50/p95/p99 latency recorded) + concurrent contention (N ≥ 10 parallel invocations, no deadlock/leak) + boundary conditions (empty/max/off-by-one, each categorised). **Chaos** (closed-set, per fix-class appropriateness): process-death injection + network-fault injection (drop/delay/reorder) + input-corruption injection + resource-exhaustion injection (disk full, OOM, FD exhaustion — refuse cleanly OR degrade, NEVER crash) + state-corruption injection (mid-flight lock loss, partial-write). Every stress + chaos PASS MUST cite a captured-evidence artefact path per §11.4.5 + §11.4.69. Helper library `stress_chaos.sh` provides `ab_stress_run`, `ab_stress_concurrent`, `ab_chaos_kill_pid_during`, `ab_chaos_drop_network_during`, `ab_chaos_corrupt_file_during`, `ab_chaos_oom_pressure_during`, `ab_chaos_disk_full_during`, each composing with `ab_pass_with_evidence` / `ab_skip_with_reason`. Cleanup non-negotiable in `trap '...' EXIT` (cleanup failure = §11.4.14 violation). Four-layer coverage per §11.4.4(b) + paired §1.1 mutation (strip chaos-injection or evidence-capture → gate FAILs). No escape hatch — no `--skip-stress`, `--no-chaos`, `--happy-path-suffices`, `--stress-test-later` flag.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.85` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-85-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker.

## §11.4.86 — Roster/Corpus-Backed Status-Doc Auto-Sync Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.86)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-25): *"Make sure that assets and players Status docs are ALWAYS regularly updated and in sync like all others Status docs — any time we add or modify the assets content(s) or we change or add new / remove existing pre-installed video and audio player apps! This MUST WORK OUT OF THE BOX!"*

Some Status docs (§11.4.45) are backed by a tracked roster (installed apps/components) or a tracked asset corpus (test/media asset directory) rather than narrative alone. Their freshness MUST NOT depend on operator vigilance — the moment a roster/corpus member changes (app added/removed/renamed; asset added/modified/removed) the Status doc + Status_Summary + HTML + PDF MUST resync out of the box, mechanically. Mechanism (all must hold): (1) drift-proof fingerprint — sha256 of the sorted member list (NOT mtime), persisted in a sidecar beside the Status doc; (2) a sync helper that regenerates the fingerprint + re-exports HTML+PDF via the §11.4.65 exporter, wired so sync is automatic; (3) a pre-build gate that FAILs when the live fingerprint differs from the persisted one (mirrors §11.4.12 `CM-ISSUES-SUMMARY-SYNC` + §11.4.45 `sync_integration_status`); (4) a paired §1.1 mutation corrupting the fingerprint and asserting the gate FAILs. Classification: universal — the consuming project supplies the specific docs, roster/corpus sources, helper, and gate name per §11.4.35.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.86` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-86-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs.

## §11.4.87 — Endless-Loop Autonomous Work + Zero-Idle Agent Dispatch + Anti-Bluff Testing Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.87)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-26): *"continue in endless loop fully autonomously"* (and any semantically-equivalent phrasing).

When the operator instructs an AI agent to continue in an endless autonomous loop, the agent MUST treat it as a HARD-CONTRACT covenant: (A) continue working until `docs/Issues.md` Status-column has zero non-terminal entries AND `docs/CONTINUATION.md` §3 Active work is empty AND no background subagent is mid-execution AND no external dependency is in-flight; (B) dispatch background subagents for parallelisable work — main + every subagent operate concurrently, "waiting for results" is the ONLY acceptable idle reason; (C) every closure lands four-layer test coverage per §11.4.4(b) with captured-evidence (audio/video/network/UI/sysfs physical proofs); (D) the §11.4 anti-bluff covenant family (§11.4.1 / §11.4.2 / §11.4.6 / §11.4.7 / §11.4.27 / §11.4.50 / §11.4.52 / §11.4.68 / §11.4.69 / §11.4.83) is the operative truth-discipline — tests AND HelixQA Challenges bound equally; (E) the loop terminates ONLY on all-conditions-met, explicit operator STOP, host-session-safety demand, or scheduled wake on a known-future-actionable signal. No escape hatch — no `--idle-OK`, `--skip-endless-loop`, `--bluff-permitted-for-this-task`, `--metadata-only-test-suffices`, `--no-physical-proof-required` flag.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.87` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-87-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker.

## §11.4.88 — Background-Push Mandate: Commit-Lock Release Immediately After Commit, Push Runs Detached (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.88)

Forensic anchor (2026-05-26): a single `commit_all.sh` held its flock ~5 hours because `do_push` ran synchronously after the commit landed — every subsequent commit blocked on a slow mirror push irrelevant to the local commit's durability. Implementation seam for §11.4.87(B) zero-idle. The mandate: (A) `.git/.commit_all.lock` MUST be released IMMEDIATELY after `git commit` returns 0 — the commit is durable on local disk regardless of remote push outcome; (B) push runs detached via `nohup ./push_all.sh ... > <log> 2>&1 &` + `disown` — the orchestrator's exit code reports COMMIT success, NOT push success; (C) `push_all.sh` acquires per-remote flock `.git/.push.<remote>.lock` so concurrent invocations targeting the same remote serialize but different-remote invocations run in parallel; (D) backgrounded push failures land in `qa-results/push_failures/<ts>_<remote>.log` — the next autonomous-loop tick checks per §11.4.87(A) "no external dependency in-flight" gate; (E) synchronous-push escape: explicit `--sync-push` CLI flag preserves legacy behaviour for §11.4.41 force-push merge-first audit paths. Gates `CM-COVENANT-114-88-PROPAGATION` + `CM-BACKGROUND-PUSH-WIRED` + paired §1.1 mutations. Synchronous push (without `--sync-push`) = §11.4 PASS-bluff at the execution layer.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.88` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-88-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker — no escape hatch beyond `--sync-push` for force-push events.

## §11.4.89 — Background Test Execution Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.89)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-27): *"Any tests we are executing, especially long test cycles, MUST BE performed in background in parallel with main work stream! This MUST NOT block our capabilities to work on queued workable items. Main work stream can be blocked or sit iddle only if absolutely needed and if it depends hard on results of some background execution."*

Symmetric anchor to §11.4.88 (background push) at the test-execution layer. Mandate: (A) long-running tests (>30 s expected: `pre_build`, `meta_test`, `test_all_fixes`, `recent_work_validate`, HelixQA banks, 4-phase cycles, full-suite retests, audio supervisors, dual-display recorders) MUST run via `nohup ... > <log> 2>&1 &` + `disown` with the log under a known dir (`qa-results/<test_id>_<ts>.log`); (B) the main stream proceeds to the §11.4.42 priority queue immediately; (C) hard-dependency gating — poll an exit-status file or `pgrep -af <test>` before steps that need the exit code, surfacing as §11.4.66 interactive options if the test is still running; (D) failures land in `<log>` files, the next loop tick checks; (E) foreground execution permitted ONLY for <30 s tests OR explicit operator authorisation; (F) per-script flock serialises same-script invocations, different-script invocations parallel. Gates `CM-COVENANT-114-89-PROPAGATION` + `CM-BACKGROUND-TEST-EXECUTION-WIRED` + paired §1.1 mutations.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.89` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-89-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker — no escape hatch beyond explicit per-invocation operator authorisation.

## §11.4.90 — Obsolete Status + Per-Item Obsolescence Audit (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.90)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-27): *"Bug No 6 ... seems obsolete after latest request for new behavior ... mark obsolete tickets with some light gray background ... text - the description to be strikethrough styled ... review all existing open or resolved workable items if they are obsolete - not valid any more ... There MUST NOT be any mistake! No bluff is allowed of any kind!"*

The §11.4.15 Status closed-set is extended with a terminal `Obsolete (→ Fixed.md)` value (orthogonal to Type per §11.4.16). Obsolescence reasons (closed vocabulary): `superseded-by-design-change | superseded-by-later-mandate | feature-removed | duplicate-of | unsupported-topology`. Every Obsolete heading MUST carry an `**Obsolete-Details:**` line (Since + Reason + Superseding-item + Triple-check evidence) within 8 non-blank lines. The §11.4.23 colorizer adds a `cell-status-obsolete` class — light-gray `#E0E0E0` background + strikethrough description. Audit cadence: every release-gate sweep per §11.4.40 + §11.4.42; triple-check is non-negotiable per the operator mandate. Composes with §11.4.15 / §11.4.16 / §11.4.19 / §11.4.21 / §11.4.23 / §11.4.33 / §11.4.34 / §11.4.40 / §11.4.42 / §11.4.66 / §11.4.71.

## §11.4.91 — Summary-Doc Clarity Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.91)

For each workable item we MUST HAVE clearly understandable meaning ... every team member can clearly understand what that particular workable item is exactly about! There cannot be misunderstanding or unclearity of any kind and no bluff allowed!"*

Every summary entry (Issues_Summary, Fixed_Summary, README doc-link, Status_Summary pages 1+2, all one-liners) MUST contain a self-contained meaningful description ≥ 6 words OR ≥ 40 chars naming SUBJECT + PROBLEM/GOAL. Forbidden one-liner anti-patterns: section labels (`Composes with`, `Closure criteria`, `Fix direction`, etc.); bare metadata fragments (`Critical`, `Bug`, `In progress`, etc.); section-marker echoes; a §-letter alone. Generators (`generate_issues_summary.sh` / `generate_fixed_summary.sh` / `update_readme_doc_links.sh` / `generate_status_summary.sh`) MUST extract from the H1/H2 heading line per the §11.4.54 ATM-NNN convention, NEVER from arbitrary downstream text, and MUST refuse anti-pattern rows — emitting a `(MISSING DESCRIPTION — fix source heading)` placeholder with visual highlight. Gate `CM-SUMMARY-CLARITY-DESCRIPTIONS` scans every summary; an anti-pattern match = FAIL. Audit cadence: every §11.4.40 + §11.4.42 sweep.

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.91` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-91-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker.

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-27): *"Every change to the project or codebase we do MUST BE evaluated in several passes and in in-depth analisys for potential new issues or problems it can introduce! ... no bluff of any kind! After we do change or set of changes this mandatory steps MUST BE taken!"*

Every non-trivial change MUST pass a 5-pass evaluation BEFORE it is commit-ready: **(Pass 1)** main-task verification — change achieves the stated goal, captured-evidence per §11.4.5/§11.4.69; **(Pass 2)** regression-blast-radius analysis — enumerate every direct dependency, demonstrate no contract break; **(Pass 3)** cross-feature interaction analysis — audit parallel features sharing state/timing/hardware/shell environment; **(Pass 4)** deep-research validation per §11.4.8 — external precedent OR "NO external solution found — original work" + CodeGraph queries per §11.4.78/§11.4.79; **(Pass 5)** anti-bluff confirmation per §11.4 / §11.4.1 / §11.4.6 / §11.4.27 / §11.4.50 / §11.4.52 / §11.4.69 / §11.4.83 — no new bluff surface introduced. Each pass is documented (commit footers OR `docs/` entries OR `qa-results/` evidence). Only after all 5 passes complete may commit/push/test/release proceed. Trivial exemption: typo / revision-bump / MD-export-regen IF zero source touched AND the commit message cites the exemption explicitly.

## §11.4.93 — SQLite-Backed Single-Source-of-Truth for Workable Items (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.93)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-27): *"There MUST be single source of truth for all of our workable items - SQlite database ... proper scripts (we recommend Go programs) ... reduce a chance for sync to be broken ... generate always all docs from DB or to re-generate Db from all docs we have in opposite direction"*

The text-based Issues/Fixed/Summary/CONTINUATION constellation is converted to a SQLite-DB-backed single source of truth. Schema mandatory tables: `items` (atm_id PK + Type + Status incl. Obsolete + Severity + title + description ≥40 chars + created/modified + composes_with JSON + current_location); `item_history` (append-only audit per §11.4.34 By/Reason/Evidence); `obsolete_details` (§11.4.90); `operator_block_details` (§11.4.21); `firebase_metadata` (§11.4.47); `meta` (schema version + last sync + integrity hash). A Go binary at `cmd/workable-items/` provides `sync md-to-db` / `db-to-md` / `diff` / `validate` / `add` / `close`; bidirectional regen is byte-identical round-trip (closed-set whitespace/section-order tolerance). `commit_all.sh` refuses on non-empty diff; `sync_issues_docs.sh` invokes the Go binary; pre-build runs `workable-items validate`. Anti-bluff: unit + integration + stress (1000-row insert + 10 concurrent writers) + chaos (mid-write SIGKILL + corrupt-DB recovery + disk-full) + paired §1.1 mutation + HelixQA Challenge `CME-WORKABLE-ITEMS-001`. The Go binary lives in the constitution submodule (`constitution/scripts/workable-items/`) per §11.4.74. Gates `CM-COVENANT-114-93-PROPAGATION` + `CM-WORKABLE-ITEMS-DB-PRESENT` + `CM-WORKABLE-ITEMS-MD-DB-IN-SYNC` + paired §1.1 mutations.

Can we work on something in parallel while build is in progress so we slowly cleanup our slate? ... do as much as possible work in background in parallel with main work stream and oreferrably using subagents-driven approach!"*

An operational catalogue for the canonical long-running workload (multi-hour containerised build per §12.9). **SAFE during build:** (A) MD/docs work; (B) generator/helper script work under `scripts/`; (C) pre-build + meta-test gate authoring + paired §1.1 mutations; (D) on-device test scripts; (E) constitution submodule edits + push; (F) any submodule commit + push per §11.4.88; (G) read-only live-ADB probes (`dumpsys`/`getprop`/`cat /proc/...`/`screencap`/`logcat`); (H) subagent dispatch per §11.4.20/§11.4.70 + §11.4.84 quiescence; (I) web research + external API queries with §11.4.10 credentials; (J) workable-items DB ops per §11.4.93+§11.4.95; (K) backgrounded pre-build + meta-test execution per §11.4.89. **UNSAFE during build:** (α) `git checkout`/`reset --hard`/`clean -df` on the source tree (use `git worktree`); (β) mass file deletes/renames under built source trees; (γ) submodule pointer updates affecting built artefacts; (δ) `out/` mutations; (ε) `make clean`/`m clobber`/`rm -rf out/`; (ζ) container destruction; (η) disk-filling breaching §12.9 free-space minimum; (θ) §12 host-session-safety breaches.

Operating-mode capstone strengthening §11.4.87 + §11.4.94 + §11.4.96: (A) every minute of conductor idle time during which work could autonomously progress AND is not genuinely blocked = a §11.4.97 violation; "as much as possible, if not it all but as much as we can" is operative — dispatch CONTINUOUSLY through the entire idle window, not just at scheduled wakes; (B) progress-update cadence — emit an operator-facing 1-line update at every commit landed / subagent return / constitutional anchor / captured evidence / milestone closure, no operator prompt required; (C) continuous physical-proof gathering per §11.4.5 + §11.4.6 + §11.4.69 — every autonomous closure cites captured-evidence (evidence path goes into the §11.4.93 `item_history.evidence_path` when the DB lands); (D) composes with §11.4.5/6/13/20/27/42/50/52/69/70/72/83/85/87/88/89/94/96; (E) the idle-only-when-blocked closed-set is unchanged from §11.4.94(A).

§11.4.93's earlier "gitignored per §11.4.30" clause is AMENDED — the DB at `docs/workable_items.db` is TRACKED in git, NEVER gitignored. It IS authoritative source data, NOT a build artefact. Every `workable-items sync md-to-db` that mutates state MUST stage + commit + push the DB alongside the MD regen per §11.4.19 atomic-move + §2.1 multi-upstream push. A WAL-checkpoint (`PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`) is required before commit-stage so the transient `.db-wal` + `.db-shm` sidecars (gitignored per §11.4.30) are safely discardable. The §11.4.77 regeneration mechanism does NOT apply — the DB IS the source.

Closes the manual-intervention gap (§11.4 / §11.4.2 / §11.4.5 / §11.4.50 / §11.4.85 / §11.4.87 / §11.4.89 / §11.4.94 did not explicitly forbid it). A live/integration/e2e/Challenge test that requires a human action during execution (typing a message, clicking UI, hand-triggering a webhook, attaching a file — anything beyond startup) is by definition a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the automation layer. (A) Every governed test — unit/integration/e2e/Challenge/stress/chaos/live — MUST be fully self-driving end-to-end, reporting PASS/FAIL/SKIP-with-reason without any further human action after startup. (B) Single permissible exception: one-time credential bootstrap performed OUTSIDE test execution (`.env` from vault, shell exports, OAuth at first install, MTProto session activation) — configuration, not test driving. (C) Live messenger/channel/agent tests: no "operator must type" prompts (drive programmatically via second account / webhook fixture / loopback); no hard-coded session UUIDs that collide with the active dev session (Herald 2026-05-28 `claude --resume` silent exit -1 lesson); no 60 s human-response windows (§11.4.50 determinism violation); re-runnability proof — PASS at `-count=3` consecutive automated invocations with self-cleaning state; §11.4.98 obsolescence audit classifies every existing test COMPLIANT vs NON-COMPLIANT; no silent-skip-reported-as-PASS or stale-evidence-as-fresh. (D) With §11.4.85 + §11.4.89 + §11.4.87 + §11.4.94 forms a continuously-validated, non-flake, anti-bluff regime. (F) Manual-dependency tests not rewritten within 30 days graduate to §11.4.90 Obsolete citing §11.4.98.

## §11.4.99 — Latest-Source Documentation Cross-Reference Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.99)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-28): *"Make sure we ALWAYS check against latest versions of services we use web / online docs before creating instructions! This situation is illustration of how we can misguide ourselves or get banned! ... These are mandatory rules / constraints and the result is consistency and safety of created instructions, guides and manuals!"*

Misguidance-by-stale-docs is the same severity class as a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the documentation layer (Herald 2026-05-28 case: a first-draft MTProto guide recommended VoIP fallback numbers and omitted the `recover@telegram.org` pre-login email — both contradicted Telegram's official docs + the gotd/td maintainer guide and could have caused a permanent account ban). Closes the gap §11.4.92 Pass 4 alludes to but does not mandate. (A) Before committing any operator-facing instruction/guide/manual/troubleshooting/setup doc, the author MUST: (1) fetch the LATEST official online documentation of the documented service/library via WebFetch / MCP / direct browsing — NEVER training data, memory, or prior committed docs; (2) cross-reference every instruction step against that source; (3) seek secondary authoritative sources (maintainer SUPPORT.md, official changelogs, vetted community FAQs) when the official source is sparse/silent; (4) cite source URLs + date in a `## Sources verified` footer in the doc; (5) cite a `Sources verified <date>: <urls>` footer in the commit message. (B) Negative findings (gaps/silences/contradictions) MUST be documented explicitly. (C) Docs older than 6 months are STALE — re-verify before citing as operator authority, at every vN.0.0 release boundary, on service breaking-change announcements, or on operator error reports. (D) Risk-classified services (messengers, cloud APIs, payment systems, AI/LLM providers, code-hosting, package managers) carry a 90-day max staleness + explicit safety warnings. (E) Composes with but is INDEPENDENT of §11.4.92 Pass 4. (G) Commit missing either footer is BLOCKED at release-gate; stale-beyond-grace docs graduate to §11.4.90 Obsolete (`Reason=stale-documentation`).

## §11.4.101 — Autonomous-Decision-Over-Blocking Mandate (cascaded from constitution submodule §11.4.101)

> Verbatim user mandate (2026-05-28): *"when working in endless working loop fully autonomously try to decide most properly about points which would block execution and wait for us. If we haven't answered now work would be blocked whole night! If possible and if that will not cause any issues make proper and most reliable and safe decision so we achieve maximal efficiency and work gets fully done!"*

In autonomous / endless-loop mode (per §11.4.87), the agent MUST minimize operator-blocking and make the safe, reliable, reversible decision itself so work is not stalled (e.g. overnight) waiting for input — §11.4.87 says keep working, §11.4.101 says HOW to clear the decision points. **Proceed-autonomously (closed-set, ALL must hold):** (a) the action is reversible OR has a captured pre-op backup per §9.2; (b) the safe choice is determinable from captured evidence per §11.4.6 (no guessing — `LIKELY`/`probably`/`seems` is NOT a determination); (c) a wrong choice's blast radius is bounded AND recoverable; (d) it composes with anti-bluff §11.4, host-safety §12, data-safety §9. **Block-only-when (BLOCK via the §11.4.66 interactive mechanism ONLY when ALL hold):** the action is irreversible AND high-blast-radius AND the safe choice cannot be determined from evidence — e.g. external-account state the agent cannot inspect, hardware it cannot access, destructive ops without backup, force-push (also §9.2 + §11.4.41), spending money or sending data to third parties. `Operator-blocked` per §11.4.21 is reached only after this rule fires AND the self-resolution-exhaustion audit completes. An unavoidable block parks one work unit — it does NOT pause the loop; the agent keeps progressing every non-blocked item in parallel per §11.4.87 + §11.4.94 (posing the question then going idle is a §11.4.94 + §11.4.97 violation). Classification: universal (§11.4.17).

**Cascade requirement:** This anchor (verbatim or by `§11.4.101` reference) MUST appear in every owned submodule's `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-101-PROPAGATION`; paired mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. Release blocker.
